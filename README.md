## Overview ‚ú®
RaidProtect is an open-source Discord bot focused on moderation and security,
built in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) using [twilight](https://twilight.rs)
libraries. It offers many features, including:

- **Real-time moderation** such as anti-spam to prevent malicious users from
  harming your community by punishing them immediately without human intervention.
- **Protection against automated accounts** with active features like a captcha
  to verify each user that join your server.
- **Powerful moderation tools** to allow your moderators to manage punishments
  easily and keep track of each member.

RaidProtect is trusted by thousands of servers around the world. To add it to
yours, follow the instructions on [our website](https://raidprotect.org).

**[üí° Feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/raidprotect/projects/2)**

### Community and support
Our community lives in our Discord server, we only use this repository to plan
the bot development. For any question about the bot, you can join our server and
contact our support team. We also provide a user documentation that explains how
the bot works.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Read the user documentation](https://docs.raidprotect.org)**  
**[‚û°Ô∏è Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/raidprotect)**

For more details, read the [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) file.

## Installation
RaidProtect is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses the latest
stable version of the compiler. It is designed to run on a Linux system, but
should also work on Windows and macOS (let us know if you have problems). It
uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its database and [KeyDB](https://keydb.dev/)
(a faster Redis fork) for the cache.

- **Open in GitPod (recommended)**: the easiest way to launch RaidProtect is to
use [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), a cloud-based IDE. This allows you to have
a ready-to-use environment with everything installed to start developing on
the bot. GitPod offers a generous free plan of 50 hours of usage per month. 

  [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/raidprotect/raidprotect)
  
- **Running locally**: make sure you have a MongoDB database and a Redis database
running an available to start the bot. A simple way is to use a Docker (or Podman)
container to launch local instances:
  ```
  $ docker run --name mongodb-raidprotect -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
  $ docker run --name keydb-raidprotect -d -p 6379:6379 eqalpha/keydb:latest
  ```

### Creating the bot account
You must create a bot account in order to launch RaidProtect. See
[this page](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
for more information on how to do this. You also need to enable the **server
member and message content intents** from the bot settings.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**

Then, invite the bot account you created in at least one server to be able to
use it. RaidProtect requires the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission ad the
`applications.commands` scope. You can get an invite URL using the OAuth Url
Generator in the Discord Developer Portal.

### Basic configuration
RaidProtect load configuration from environment variables prefixed with `RAIDPROTECT_`.

- If you are using GitPod, you can set project-specific environment variables
  using command line or in your account settings
  ([instructions](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables/#project-specific-environment-variables)). 
  This is the preferred way to persist variables between multiple workspace.
- If you develop locally, you can write your environment variables in a `.env`
  file in the project root. These variables will be loaded when the bot launches.

**The only required configuration is the bot token** with the `RAIDPROTECT_TOKEN`
environment variable. This token can be obtained from the Discord Developer
Portal.

For a complete and up-to-date list of available configuration options, refer to
the [`raidprotect/src/config.rs`](raidprotect/src/config.rs) file.

### Starting the bot
You should be able to compile and launch the bot with `cargo run` (ensure that
both MongoDB and KeyDB/Redis are running locally with the default port - the
connection uri can be changed with environment variables). Feel free to ask in
our Discord server if you run into any problem.

Congratulations, you now have a working local instance of RaidProtect. üéâ
