//! Shutdown handling.
//!
//! These types are used to manage graceful shutdown of running tasks.
//!
//! ## Shutdown strategy
//! All running tasks can be represented as a dependency tree. When a shutdown
//! is requested from a top-level task, this task will forward the shutdown
//! signal to all subtasks (for example, connections of a server) and wait until
//! they gracefully shutdown, with a timeout to avoid blocking shutdown.
//!
//! This strategy is applied recursively until all tasks gracefully shutdown.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! Each task that will have dependencies should initialize a [`Shutdown`] type.
//! This type will be used to sent shutdown signal to child tasks. The child tasks
//! are tracked with a [`ShutdownSubscriber`] type, that is used both to receive the
//! shutdown signal and know when sub-tasks have stopped.
//!
//! Internally, a [`broadcast`] channel is used to emit shutdown signal, and a [`mpsc`]
//! channel is used to know when all subtasks are dropped.
