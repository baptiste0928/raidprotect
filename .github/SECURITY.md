# Security policy

We take security seriously at RaidProtect and are open to security reports. In
case you found a security vulnerability, please contact us privately on Discord
([discord.gg/raidprotect](https://discord.gg/raidprotect)). If needed, we will
setup a secure communication channel to sent details about the security 
vulnerability. **Do not use repository issues to report security vulnerabilities.**

We are committed to providing a response quickly to security reports, and to
transparency in the security issue disclosure process. Security issues will
be announced once fixed using GitHub Security Advisories.

Thank you for helping to make RaidProtect safer!
